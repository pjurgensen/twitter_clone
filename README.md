#Twitter clone
##Epicodus: Ruby on Rails project
###Patti Jurgensen

For today's project, let's make a clone of Twitter.

* Start off with user signups. When somebody signs up, send them a welcome email.

* Then, let users post tweets. If another user's handle is mentioned in the tweet, send that user a notification email.

* Now, let users follow each other. Of course, notify somebody by email if when they are followed. Add pages showing who a user follows, and who follows them.

* Let users upload photos in their tweets.

* Add pagination, or the splitting up of a big list into several pages, to your index views, using Kaminari.

* Create a preferences page where users can opt out of different notifications.
